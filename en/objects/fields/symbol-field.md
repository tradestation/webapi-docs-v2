Symbology is the way in which TradeStation interprets symbol data from the TradeStaton Network for display or when passing a Symbol Name to a request when calling the TradeStation WebAPI.

### International Symbology

For international equities, the symbol name syntax follows this scheme:

* {country code}:{symbol name/number}

For example

Note: for US markets, the country prefix can be omitted.

###Detailed Symbology Explanation

For a more comprehensive explanation of symbology for all asset-types, see the following documentation:
